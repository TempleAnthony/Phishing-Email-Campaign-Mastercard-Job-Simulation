## 📌 Overview  

This repository documents my work during the Mastercard Cybersecurity Job Simulation, where I served on the Security Awareness Team. I was responsible for leading a phishing simulation campaign and creating customized cybersecurity awareness materials for high-risk departments within the organization.

## 🎯 Phishing Simulation Campaign  

The project began with a real phishing email that had been sent to some Mastercard employees by an external bad actor. Although the attack failed—due to the email being obviously fake—it revealed how close some attempts are to succeeding.

**My task:**  
Redesign the original phishing email to make it more convincing, and use it to launch an internal phishing simulation campaign to test employee awareness and response.

## 📊 Key Findings from the Simulation  

After rolling out the simulation internally, we tracked key metrics including:  

- **Email Open Rate**  
- **Click-Through Rate (CTR)**  
- **Phishing Success Rate**

The departments with the **highest vulnerability** were:  
- **Human Resources (HR)**  
- **Email Marketing Team**

These teams had the highest open and click-through rates, and a significant number of users fell for the phishing bait. This revealed a clear need for focused training and awareness efforts in these areas.

## 🛡️ Cybersecurity Awareness Materials  

In response, I developed a set of tailored cybersecurity training resources for the most vulnerable departments. These included:  

- **Phishing Red Flag Checklist**  
- **Interactive Email Safety Workshop Slides**  
- **“Think Before You Click” Poster Series**  
- **Weekly Security Tips Email Series**  
- **Real vs Fake Email Comparison Guide**

All materials were designed to be engaging, simple to understand, and specific to the type of email activity those departments typically handle.
